# This script is provided as a callback to the NSI and MNO-VAD applications to
# handle the progress report. It stores the progress reports at a location
# which is controlled by the `client.sh` script through environment variables.
# The progress reports are stored with increasing number suffixes. Therefore,
# it iterates from 0 to find a number which has not been used. The created
# files are then verified against the pre-verified copies in this test directory.
# This test is not done in here to keep the testing logic in one file.
